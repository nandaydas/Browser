# Browser

A simple homepage template for basic browser applications, including the Kodular `.aia` source file.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project provides:

- A minimal **HTML/CSS/JS** homepage template (in `index.html`) suitable for embedding in browser-based apps  
- A **Kodular `.aia`** file (in `Browser.aia`) that uses this template, enabling drag-and-drop app builders to integrate it  
- A lightweight, no-frills starting point for custom browser wrapper apps or hybrid applications  

Use this as your starting layout for a basic browser interface, then extend or theme it per your needs.
